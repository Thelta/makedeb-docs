There's various ways you can contribute to the makedeb project! There's always some work that needs done, and any form of help you can provide is greatly appreciated.

## Creating packages for the MPR
If you have something that you or someone else needs packaged, or you just want to get your hands into packaging, the [MPR](/using-the-mpr) provides an excellent way to do such for the makedeb community.

To create a new package, follow the guide for [uploading packages to the MPR](/using-the-mpr/uploading-packages).

## Contribute code
We're always looking for more contributors to the codebases for makedeb's projects! There's always some bugs that need fixed, and if you're feeling extra adventurous you may even get some new features integrated, led by you!

If you're familiar with programming, or you just want to start doing such, makedeb's projects provide an excellent way to do so while supporting products people use every day.

### Projects
makedeb's main projects are makedeb itself and the MPR. If you're familiar with Bash, makedeb provides the easiest way to start contributing, while the MPR has a heavy reliance on Python if you're more suited with that.

- makedeb: <https://github.com/makedeb/makedeb>
- MPR: <https://github.com/makedeb/mprweb>

There are also a few side projects for those who are interested:

- [makedeb.org](https://github.com/makedeb/makedeb.org): The homepage for the makedeb project.
- [makedeb-docs](https://github.com/makedeb/makedeb-docs): The documentation for the makedeb project.
- [makedeb-matrix](https://github.com/makedeb/makedeb-matrix): The makedeb bot seen in makedeb's support rooms.
- [makedeb-docker](https://github.com/makedeb/makedeb-docker): Scripts and configurations used to deploy makedeb's [Docker images](/installing/docker).
- [makedeb-srcinfo](https://github.com/makedeb/makedeb-srcinfo): Python library to parse makedeb-styled `.SRCINFO` files.

## Other ways you can help
### Spread the word
One of the simplest, yet most effective methods of helping the makedeb project is to just spread the word that makedeb exists.

Bringing in more users increases awareness of makedeb in all aspects, allowing more and more people to use a tool that many are already using as their primary packaging system.

### Star the project
You can also increase awareness of makedeb by starring makedeb on GitHub. You can do so on makedeb's [GitHub page](https://github.com/makedeb/makedeb), and then clicking the "Star" button in the top right corner.

By adding a star, you help others to find makedeb more easily, as well as show that makedeb has already proven to be useful for you.
