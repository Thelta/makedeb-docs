This page tracks ways the makedeb community can hang out in a more relaxed manner, without necessarily dealing with makedeb-related stuff. If you have something you'd like added, feel free to make an issue.

## Minecraft
makedeb has an official Minecraft server for the makedeb community to engage in. It's a vanilla-based survival server set to the `normal` difficulty. You'll need a Minecraft Java client, and you can connect to it from the following:
- Server Name: `makedeb`
- Server Address: `minecraft.makedeb.org`
