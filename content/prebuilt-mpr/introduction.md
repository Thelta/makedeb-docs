The Prebuilt-MPR serves precompiled binaries for packages on the MPR.

It provides a fast and easy way to install packages from the MPR, making it ideal for environments such as CI systems and beginner-oriented users who might have a worse experience with building from source.

## Security of the Prebuilt-MPR
All packages inside of the Prebuilt-MPR must first go through a [review process](https://{{< github_url >}}/makedeb/prebuilt-mpr-v2/#security), including any version updates.

You should thus be fine installing any package from the Prebuilt-MPR, though as with any user-based repository, you should still exert caution and only install packages that you deem to be safe.
